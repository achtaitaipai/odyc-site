A sprite is represented as a string of characters, with each line corresponding to a row of pixels. Here's an example of a sprite:

```js
 sprite: `
          ...00...
          ...00...
          .000000.
          0.0000.0
          0.0000.0
          ..0000..
          ..0..0..
          ..0..0..
      `,
```

Each digit is interpreted as a color (0: black, 1: white...), while spaces, tabs, and empty lines are ignored. Other characters represent transparent pixels.

In the example, the character `.` is used to mark empty spaces, but it could just as well be an underscore `_`.

> [!WARNING]
> In JavaScript, to create a multi-line string, we use the backtick character: `
>
> - On Windows: <kbd>AltGr</kbd> + <kbd>7</kbd> then <kbd>Space</kbd>
> - On Mac: <kbd>Â£</kbd> then <kbd>Space</kbd>

Try to design a sprite for the player.
