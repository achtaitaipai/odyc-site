Welcome to the OdyCJS tutorial! This guide is designed to teach you how to use OdyC, a JavaScript library for creating narrative games. Whether you're a programming beginner or an experienced developer, OdyCJS offers the necessary tools to turn your ideas into interactive games.

The tutorial is divided into sections, each focusing on a key feature. You'll learn step by step how to build a game, from setting up your project to adding complexity to your creation.

> [!NOTE]
> This tutorial aims to cover the essential aspects of OdyC. However, it's not necessary to master every detail to start creating your own game. Feel free to experiment on your own and return to the tutorial to deepen your knowledge whenever you need.

## Creating a Game with `createGame()`

The first step in creating a game with OdyCJS is to use the `createGame()` function. This function initializes your game, creating a new project ready to be customized with your own scenarios, characters, and game logic.

Here's what your code should look like:

```js
createGame()
```

This simple line of code is the starting point for all games created with OdyCJS. It sets the stage for adding game elements, such as scenes, dialogues, and interactions.

### Exercise

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to initialize your first game using `createGame()`. Write the necessary code in the playground and observe how OdyCJS prepares your game's environment. If everything is correct, you will see a basic game framework appear, ready to be enriched.

Remember: game development is a creative adventure. Don't hesitate to experiment and play with the code to see what you can create!
